<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Angular 2 ushered in the apocalypse when it was announced a few years ago and it looked <strong>nothing</strong> like the current version of Angular 1.x we were using. The initial gap between the two versions seemed to be like standing on opposite sides of a canyon with the obvious question being "How in the world do we get from here to there?!"</p>
<p>I shared this sentiment, but as I began to learn Angular 2, a funny thing started to happen. How I thought about web applications, in general, started to shift and my Angular 1.x applications began to look more and more like Angular 2 applications. I started using ES6, everything became a component, data started to flow down and events flowed up, etc. Migration path aside, embracing this approach made my Angular 1.x applications <strong>much</strong> better. Here are the slides from my <strong>Embrace the Angular 2 Ethos in Angular 1.x</strong> and be sure to check out the resources below for more information about how to writing Angular 1.x applications in an Angular 2 style.</p>
