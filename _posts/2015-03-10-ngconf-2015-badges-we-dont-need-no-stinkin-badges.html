<h2>The Conference</h2>
<p>One of the highlights of my career was introducing my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/filearts" title="Geoff Goodman" target="_blank">Geoff Goodman</a> to the AngularJS community. Geoff has been a huge inspiration to me over the last couple years and made me realize that we do not need external validation (badges) to produce awesome things. The story of how he created <a href="http://plnkr.co/" title="Plunker" target="_blank">Plunker</a> is fascinating and has challenged me to be a better version of myself. </p>
<p>I had a really great time presenting with Geoff but please do not let the message get lost in all the revelry. If we can convince just one person to get out of their comfort zone and try something new, all the work and agony of getting in front of hundreds of people will have been totally worth it. #noBadges!</p>
